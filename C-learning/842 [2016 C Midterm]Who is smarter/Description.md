# [2016 C Midterm]Who is smarter?

## Description

Alan is very smart. His IQ was **just 0 on his birthday**. But it **grows 1 everyday**.

For example, when Alan is 1 year old, his IQ is 365!

Nick is smarter then Alan. His IQ **was 1 on his birthday**, and **grows 1 times every day**.

Alan's IQ is x when he is n years old. Nick's IQ is y when he is m years old.
