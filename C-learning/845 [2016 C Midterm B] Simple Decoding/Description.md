# [2016 C Midterm B] Simple Decoding

# Description

Some text that consists of 'a' - 'z', 'A' - 'Z' and ' ' has been encoded into a series of numbers according to the following rules:

```
' ' -> 000
'a' -> 001
'b' -> 002
'c' -> 003
...
'y' -> 025
'z' -> 026

'A' -> 101
'B' -> 102
'C' -> 103
...
'Y' -> 125
'Z' -> 126

```

You are supposed to decode the series of numbers and show the original text.
